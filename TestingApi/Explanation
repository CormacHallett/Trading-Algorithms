This is going to be a super basic trading algorithm so I can get used to the api. 

ChatGPT is giving me the idea on what to do, as well as the code. I am testing the code and making sure it works, then will mess with the code and rewrite it. Overall, this 
is not my own algorithm or my own code.


This is going to be a moving average crossover strategy. When the older and newer moving averages cross, the idea is that it will show when the momentum of the stock is either 
rising or falling. This is super, duper basic and I won't be including any risk managment. I assume that this will not have any solid profits on the backtest because simply, it sounds 
dumb. Probably can be made better, but this is just a way to figure out how to actually run an algorithm, so returns are not the goal.
